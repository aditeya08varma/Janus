CONCEPT DEFINITION: 2026 GRAPH DATA & TERMINOLOGY
- Note: This file contains only data that is visual (Graphs) or slang (Terminology).

1. FUEL FLOW FORMULAS (GRAPH DATA)
- The PDF displays this as a chart; here is the derived formula.
- 2025 Formula (Below 10,500 RPM): Q (kg/h) = 0.009 * RPM + 5.5.
- 2025 Formula (Above 10,500 RPM): Flat limit of 100 kg/h.

2. 2026 MANUAL OVERRIDE PROFILE (GRAPH DATA)
- The PDF displays this as a power curve profile.
- Standard Mode: Power tapers linearly from 350kW at 290 kph to 0 kW at 355 kph.
- Override Mode: Power stays at full 350 kW until 337 kph, then tapers to 0 kW at 355 kph.

3. TERMINOLOGY MAPPING (SLANG)
- "X-Mode" = "Straight Mode" (Low Drag / Open Wing).
- "Z-Mode" = "Corner Mode" (High Downforce / Closed Wing).

4. SPORTING REGULATIONS (OVERTAKE LOGIC)
- Manual Override Mode (MOM) / Overtake Button: Can ONLY be activated when the driver is <1 second behind another car (similar to DRS). Leaders cannot use it to defend.
